# Public Satellite Node

Public Satellite node is designed to be run on a server as a dedicated nostr relay and [blossom](https://github.com/hzrd149/blossom) server for a community.

### Run it

Clone into the repo and

`npm i`

`npm run build` (to build typescript)

You'll need an .env file like:

```
DATA_PATH=./data
PORT=2001
SECRET_KEY=""
ENABLE_HYPER_DHT=true
```
where

- `DATA_PATH` is the directory to store the community's event database, blobs, and config
- `PORT` is the port to make the nostr relay will run on
- `SECRET_KEY` is a nostr secret key used by the relay to sign messages on it's own behalf (see [NIP-29](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/29.md))

then

`npm run dev`
